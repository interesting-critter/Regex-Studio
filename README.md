# Regex Studio

**Regex Studio** is a text transformation tool for Lumiverse. It lets you find, replace, and clean up text across single character cards, multiple cards at once, world books, or a custom scratchpad using regex patterns and reusable multi-step pipelines.

---

## What It Does

* **Edit Across Multiple Sources**: Work on a single character card, batch-edit dozens of cards at once, update lorebook entries, or any other text in a blank scratchpad.
* **Tag & Field Filtering**: Filter characters by include/exclude tags, and choose exactly which fields to load (greetings, descriptions, dialogue, system prompts, etc.).
* **Find & Replace**: Regex or plain-text search with full flag toggles (`g`, `i`, `m`, `s`), match navigation (`◀` / `▶`), and automatic scroll-to-match highlighting.
* **Pipeline Presets**: Chain multiple regex steps together into a sequential pipeline. Save and manage presets to re-run complex formatting passes with one click.
* **Diff Preview Before Saving**: Review exact word-level deletions and additions before applying changes, with checkboxes to exclude individual fields from the update.
* **Safe Editing**: Full undo/redo history, copy-all to clipboard, and instant reset back to original text. Nothing is truly edited until you hit save.
